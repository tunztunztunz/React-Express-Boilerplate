# React-Express-Boilerplate

Right now, this boilerplate uses two terminal windows to run both Node.js and React in the
development environment.

For development run `npm run node-dev` to start local server at `localhost:5000` and run `npm run react-dev` to run react server at `localhost:3000`.

The application will use build command to build React app and move it to `/build/` folder.
